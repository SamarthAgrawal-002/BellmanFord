While working on the Bellman–Ford algorithm, I realized that I don’t need to fully master an algorithm to start learning from it. 
I learned how shortest path algorithms gradually improve answers through repeated updates rather than finding the solution in one step. 
I also understood the idea of relaxation, where distances are updated only when a better path is found.
Although I’m still developing a clear intuition for why it runs V−1 times, this task helped me see how negative edge weights and negative cycles affect shortest path problems, 
something simpler algorithms like Dijkstra cannot handle. Overall, this exercise taught me how to read unfamiliar logic, implement it carefully, 
and learn by experimenting rather than memorizing.
